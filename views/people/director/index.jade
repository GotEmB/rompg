		p A former chair of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, Professor Liou is presently a Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Sciences. He joined UCLA in 1997 after a 22-year career as Professor of Meteorology, Adjunct Professor of Physics and Geophysics, Director of the Center for Atmospheric and Remote Sounding Studies, and department Chairman at the University of Utah.
		p Among numerous pioneering and fundamental contributions in the areas of light scattering by nonspherical ice crystals, radiative transfer theory and application, satellite remote sensing, and clouds and aerosols in climate and greenhouse warming, Professor Liou is best known for his three books: An Introduction to Atmospheric Radiation (1980, translated into Chinese, Russian, and Arabic), Radiation and Cloud Processes in the Atmosphere: Theory, Observation, and Modeling (1992), and An Introduction to Atmospheric Radiation, 2nd Edition (2002, translated into Chinese in 2005). Professor Liou also authored or co-authored more than 220 peer-reviewed publications that have appeared in numerous national and international journals.
		p Professor Liou was elected a Member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 and a Member of the Academia Sinica (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Taiwan) in 2004. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, the Optical Society of America, and the American Meteorology Society. Professor Liou received a creativity award from the National Science Foundation in 1996 for his work on light scattering by ice crystals. This award was followed in 1998 by the Jule G. Charney Award from the American Meteorological Society “for his pioneering work in the theory and application of radiative transport and its interaction with clouds.” Professor Liou also shared the Nobel Peace Prize bestowed on IPCC in 2007. He received the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) William Nordberg Medal at the 38th COSPAR Scientific Assembly in Bremen, Germany in 2010. The Nordberg Medal, awarded every two years, recognizes the contributions of leading scientists to the application of space science. In 2012, Professor Liou received the International Radiation Commission (IRC) Quadrennial Gold Medal at the 2012 IRC Symposium held in Berlin, Germany, for his "contributions of lasting significance to the field of radiation research."
		p Recognizing the potential significance for productive research collaboration on climate modeling and environmental change, Professor Liou and Dr. Randy Friedl, Chief Scientist for Earth Science and Technology Directorate, spearheaded the establishment in March 2005, of a joint (UCLA and JPL) institute in the Earth System Science field. The Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering (JIFRESSE) was subsequently established at UCLA and, in July 2006, Professor Liou was appointed by the UCLA Vice Chancellor for Research, Dr. Roberto Peccei, as its founding director.

				h4 Dr. Randall Friedl
				p Adjunct Professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences
		p Dr. Friedl is currently serving as Deputy Director for Research, Engineering and Science Directorate. In addition, he is a member of the JPL Science and Technology Management Council that oversees all of JPL’s internal research and technology development investments.
		p Dr. Friedl received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Harvard University in 1984 prior to accepting a research position at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr Friedl's research is focused on gas and particle reactions relevant to the Earth's stratosphere and troposphere. For his early research work he received JPL’s Lew Allen Award for Excellence in 1990. He has authored or co-authored over 50 scientific publications and has participated in a number of international assessments, notably, as lead author for the IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (1999), as contributing author for the IPCC Third Assessment Report on Climate Change (2001), and as co-author on the WMO Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (2002). He has also served as the Research Focal Point for the Emissions working group of the United Nation’s Civil Aviation Environmental Program from 2001 to 2003. More recently, he was a panel member on the National Research Council’s first-ever “Decadal Survey” on Earth Science that was released in January 2007.
		p In addition to his JPL activities, Dr. Friedl has served several roles at NASA Headquarters. From 1994 to 1996 he was the Project Scientist for the Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project. During that tenure, he developed and organized numerous research efforts, including several aircraft field campaigns to study aircraft impacts on the upper troposphere. Following his return to JPL, he served as co-mission scientist for the NASA ACCENT airborne field study to investigate aircraft and rocket impacts and served as flight scientist in the CRYSTAL-FACE campaign to study cirrus cloud processes in Florida. For his work on the aviation-related issues he received a NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1997 and a NASA Group Achievement Award in 1999.
		p Prior to reassuming his current JPL position at the beginning of 2009, Dr. Friedl spent a year and a half at NASA Headquarter as the Deputy Chief Scientist for Earth Science within the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and as the Deputy for Science within the Earth Science Division of SMD. In those roles, Dr. Friedl was the primary advisor on Earth science issues to the NASA Associate Administrator and Earth Science Director and was tasked with formulating internal strategy for the NASA Earth science program as well as joint strategies with other Federal agencies.
