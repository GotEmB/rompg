		p Dr. Yi Chao is a Principal Scientist at Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc. He is an Adjunct Professor at UCLA JIFRESSE and Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. He received both the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from Princeton University, and the B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China.
		p During 1993-2011, Dr. Chao was a Principal Scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, where he was involved in numerous ocean remote-sensing and science projects. He was the Project Scientist for the Aquarius mission developing the first NASA satellite to measure ocean salinity from space. He also took several management positions at JPL ranging from Group Supervisor to Section Manager.
		p Dr. Chao was also a PI funded by the Office of Naval Research to have successfully developed, deployed and recovered the first profiling float completely powered by the ocean temperature differences. He is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of Seatrec, Inc. to commercialize this thermal recharging technology for underwater applications.

				a(href = "farraraj@yahoo.com") farraraj@yahoo.com
		p Dr. John D. Farrara is a Researcher in the Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering at UCLA. He received his PhD degree from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at UCLA in 1989.
		p Dr. Farrara's research since then has been centered on numerical modeling of the atmosphere and ocean on regional to global scales. His recent work has been concentrated on applications of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in coastal ocean regions.
		p One such region is the California coast, another is the Prince William Sound Region in Alaska, where he piloted a ROMS-based data-assimilating real-time nowcast-forecast system in support of the summer 2009 Sound Predictions experiment. During the experiment, the system was run daily in real-time to support operations, particularly the tracking and deployment of drifters. Nowcasts were produced every 6 hours and a 48-hr forecast was run once per day. A sixteen-member ensemble of forecasts was also executed on most days in order to estimate the uncertainties in forecasted quantities. A similar system setup is currently being run in near-realtime for both regions in support of several activities in these regions.
